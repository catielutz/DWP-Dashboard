              <p class="h5 mx-5">Our team was inspired to understand to a greater extent the occurrence of teen pregnancy and birth across the United States. 
                Initially, we wanted to investigate the overall trends and correlations between the rate of teen births and other factors, such as age and location.</p>
              <p class="h5 mx-5">Building upon our <a href="https://github.com/Kylee-Grant/Project-2">prior work</a>, we aimed
                to use machine learning to predict the effect access to contraception and family planning services has on teen pregnancy and birth rates.
                We hope that the visualizations and resulting model of this project help elucidate the recent birth rate trends and most efficacious
                interventions in the outcomes of teen pregnancies and births.</p>

                        <p class="h6">Social vulnerability refers to the potential negative effects on communities caused by external stresses on human health. Such stresses include natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks. Reducing social vulnerability can decrease both human suffering and economic loss. The CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (CDC/ATSDR SVI) uses 15 U.S. census variables to help local officials identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters.

                  <p class="h6">The strongest correlation we found to teen pregnancy was the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The
                    SVI is an aggregation of social and demographic data including employment, access to transportation,
                    crowding, and language. It was designed to help officials direct public health and emergency response
                    resources to vulnerable populations.</p>
                  <p class="h6">We found that a county’s teen pregnancy rate had a strong, linear relationship with its SVI score (R^2 =
                    .46, P < 10^15), meaning that SVI can account for 46% of our model’s prediction of a teen birth rate.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="h6">The SVI is about identifying places where health resources are harder to access, and its correlation
                    with the teen birth rate shows that teen pregnancy is not a moral problem, but one of access to
                    healthcare.</p>
